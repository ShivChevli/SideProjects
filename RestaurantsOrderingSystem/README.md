For building this system many Advance Topices of C Language has been used like 
<ul>
    <li> File managemnet</li>
    <li> Pointers</li>
    <li> Datastructure</li>
    <li> Dynamic Memory allocation</li>
    <li> String Manuplation</li>
</ul>
and many more. This Program also use software engineering principals. It has created many custom header files for diffrent perpouses like for custome datatype , Custome Utilityfunctions and five additional files for each modules of system.
